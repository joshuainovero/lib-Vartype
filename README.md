# lib-Vartype #
libvartype is a C++ open source library that can hold primitive and non-primitive data types in a user-defined variable.
This library will enable users to create objects or instances from the class "vartype" which can automatically assign an
appropriate value to the instance without specifying the data type. Below are the list of supported data types for the class
"vartype" :
- 32 bit signed integers
- 32 and 64 bit floating points
- Strings
- Single characters

# Features #
- Type erasure which means that any value may be held in a single variable
- It converts between any type of data
- No data leakage in the process of conve
- Multiply data types in a vector are well supported
